            Landing page for TAFE (an internal site for test automation). 
            Technology Used: 	Asp.net web form, Tsql,  c#,  javascript,   html,  
                                css,  Ajax,  jquery

            I worked on other projects as well, notably a c# library for remote 
            connection with routers using vralib from vyndyk. Before that, i was 
            tasked to test various library such as Rensi.sshNet,  ComponentPro
            and vyndyk. I was told i saved significant amount of money through
            these test because if we had kept on using the wrong library the cost
            would have been big.
