ACADEMIC PROJECTS:
Course - Principles and Practice of Distributed Programming
Course Project  - Client Server chat system based on distributed patterns
	Created an Application to support chatting functionality between clients who have logged into the

	Another pattern used is Acceptor-Connector pattern for decoupling service initialization and
	connection establishment from processing done with services and connections are established.
Course  - Real Time Concurrent Systems
Course Project - TFTP application with user controlled error simulation
	In a team of four, designed and implemented a file transfer system based on the TFTP specification
	(RFC 1350). The system consists of TFTP client running on one or several computers, an Error
